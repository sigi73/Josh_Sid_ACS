# In Memory Key Value Store

## Project Overview
In this project we implement an in-memory key-value store using a hash-table indexing data structure. 

We plan to support at least the GET, PUT, and DELETE operations. (We will update this list as the project progresses).
We will also support concurrency control through mutual exclusion with mutexes. 
The hashtable implemention will require re-hashing to adjust the hash-table size as the data size changes.
We also will implement an additional feature of serialization to disk.

The in-memory key-value store is a very commonly used indexing data structure for it's easy use to quickly access data from keys.
